PyDiff is the brand new Cardiff based Python and Django user group. We will be meeting monthly to share ideas, learn and have lots of fun! Meetings will probably be at the School of Mathematics on Senghennydd Road, Cathays, and we will keep you posted here about the date of the first meeting.

In the meantime, keep and eye on this website and follow us on twitter [@PyDiff](https://twitter.com/PyDiff). We are excited to meet you.
