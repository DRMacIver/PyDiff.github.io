# Matt J. Williams â€“ Mining Github and Meetup.com to Explore the UK's Digital Tech Clusters

What can Github and Meetup.com tell us about the UK's digital tech clusters? In this talk I will describe how Python was used to mine these online platforms to compare programming expertise and tech communities in different regions of the UK. These data contributed to the recently launched [Tech Nation 2016](http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/tech-nation-2016) report, which provides a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the UK's digital tech clusters.
