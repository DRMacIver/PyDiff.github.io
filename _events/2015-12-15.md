# Martin Chorley - What Python can Teach us about Beer

We've recently been using Python to analyse the drinking habits of over 200,000 people around the USA and Europe. In this talk I'll show you some of the Python data analysis tools we've used and what we've been doing with them, and some of the (hopefully interesting) things we've found out.

# Lighting talks

A highlight of every python conference, we're going to have them at our meetup
:)
Prepare a 5 minute lightning talk about something that might be of interest to
the group :)
