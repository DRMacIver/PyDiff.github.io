This is the website for PyDiff, the Cardiff based Python and Django user group. The group was formed after the successful [DjangoCon Europe](http://2015.djangocon.eu) in Cardiff in 2015.

This website, along with our twitter account [@Pydiff](https://twitter.com/PyDiff), will post meeting dates and general information for the group.
